This paper argues that in the 21st century, with the unprecedented power of science and technology, the ethical responsibility of scientists must undergo a fundamental paradigm shift: from a traditional focus on research integrity to an active engagement with the social consequences of their scientific results. The paper begins by deconstructing the myth of scientific "value-neutrality," revealing the inherent ways in which non-epistemic values permeate research. It employs deontological, consequentialist, and virtue ethics as analytical frameworks. Through critical case studies—the Manhattan Project, Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems , and biotechnology—the paper illustrates the profound ethical dilemmas and humanitarian challenges that arise when scientific achievements are misused or generate unforeseen systemic risks. These cases collectively demonstrate that the "dual-use" dilemma of science necessitates a more proactive and forward-looking governance framework. Consequently, the paper examines the evolution of governance models, from scientist self-regulation (exemplified by the Asilomar Conference) to global multi-stakeholder co-governance. It concludes by advocating for a new social contract for science, centered on "Responsible Innovation" and "moral foresight." This contract requires the integration of ethical considerations throughout the entire research process, positioning science explicitly as a common good serving human welfare. It emphasizes that the scientific community must transform from a passive provider of knowledge into a moral agent proactively responsible for the future it helps to shape.
